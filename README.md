# MOD8_Project

# 1. Project problem statement.
Develop a to do list with 3 status: To do, doing, done.
To access the to do list the user must pass through a login page.
All pages must be secure using a token to store the session.

# 2. Project Description.
Frontend Layer
A front-end designed with Vue.js, using the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Model-ViewView-Model (MVVM) architecture.
API / Service Layer
A service should be created to support all front-end requests, but it must not stop there. It should be
designed in a flexible way to support future requirements.
Use of time-based tokens for the authentication process. Using the token for all subsequent requests.
Important: A public web server should be used to host the service / database of the application.
Business Layer / Entity Layer
The business layer serves the purpose of storing the entity definitions and providing user-accessible
methods as an abstracted interface to the application’s data. IT should be easy to use, it should make
use of business objects, and most importantly it should provide the validation necessary to ensure clean
data.
Database Layer
The database layer exists to persist data.
The database to be used is MySQL.

# 3. Work breakdown approach.
The project is broken down into four Milestones. For each week of the course duration.
Milestone: Each milestone is considered to be an assignment in itself which should adhere to the late
policies of the course

# Milestone 1 : Documentation and Design. (20%)
1. Approval of the project structure and design (the theme, or purpose also).
2. Project design (UML charts, structure charts, etc…)
3. Wireframe examples of the front-end (with the understanding they may change).
4. Initial design of database tables required.
5. Work not completed at this milestone would be penalized.

# Milestone 2: Prototype (20%)
1. The front-end should be “mostly” functional at this point.
2. The API should also be functional with the required HTTP methods in place to allow the frontend to work.
3. The back-end should include the business layer and entities. But the data tier is optional. Data
can be “mocked” at this point using non-persistent data such as lists, dictionaries or hashmaps.

# Milestone 3: Completed Project and Presentation (40%)
1. The project is complete and functional. Nothing is left to do.
2. Security must be implemented into the API/Frontend at this point. No requests should be
allowed to happen to the web service without proper authorization in place.

# Presentation 5 - 7 min. (20%)
Explaining the project (front-end and backend)
Brief explanation of challenges encountered and how they were resolved.

# 4. Deliverable Format.
Documentation and Design
For each deliverable, documentation is important.
1. User relevant images, charts for more explanation.
2. Submit it on portal late submission will not be evaluated.
3. Documentation must include:
• Cover page with student names.
• Brief introduction of the project explaining the main objective and the technologies that will be
used during the development.
• Brief description of the role of each student during the development of the project
• Project plan divided into 3 sprints (one for each milestone) with the description of the backlog,
the resources needed and the effort (in time).
• Presentation and explanation of all graphs, diagrams, and models.
4. Propre documentation: Font size: 11px.
● Font: Arial.
● Heading: Bold (if necessary).
● Number of pages: Not more than 5 pages. **(Depends).
● Include references: url of website. Evaluation, done on all the above criteria. Follow the
evaluation process.
Prototype
Project file compressed in ZIP format, including database SQL file (data and structure).
Completed Project and Presentation
Compressed folder in ZIP format, including:
● Final prototype files with new changes
● Final database SQL file (data and structure).
● Final documentation with all changes done during the project.
● Presentation file.
Not following the deliverable format, has a penalty on the milestone grading.

# 5. References.
It includes the source from which you have gathered the ideas and knowledge to implement during each
deliverable. Include URLs.
